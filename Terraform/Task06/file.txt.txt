We need to make a Script in which we should get an alert if new EC2 resource get deploy to our AWS Infra.
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" 
  access_key = "ifyoucan"
  secret_key ="cracked"
}
# Create an SNS topic
resource "aws_sns_topic" "resource_creation_topic" {
  name = "CreationTopic"
}

# Create an SNS subscription (you can replace the endpoint with your own, such as email)
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "resource_creation_subscription" {
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.resource_creation_topic.arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = "org@gmail.com"
}

# Create a CloudWatch Events rule to capture resource creation events
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "resource_creation_rule" {
  name        = "ResourceCreationRule"
  description = "Captures resource creation events"
  
  event_pattern = jsonencode({
    
  "source": ["aws.ec2"],
  "detail-type": ["EC2 Instance State-change Notification"],
  "detail": {
    "state": ["pending"]
  }

  })
}

# Associate the CloudWatch Events rule with the SNS topic
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_target" "resource_creation_target" {
  rule      = aws_cloudwatch_event_rule.resource_creation_rule.name
  target_id = "ResourceCreationTarget"
  arn       = aws_sns_topic.resource_creation_topic.arn
}
