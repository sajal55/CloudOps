We need to create a dashboard and in this particular dashboard we need to fetch the CPU utilization of Ec2 instance by SQL Query:

1)First Approach : I need to deploy 2 ec2 instance by terraform  and create a dashboard and then manually need to deploy the SQL query. 

2) Second Approach : Automate all this by terraform . 

attaching code of Second Approach:

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1" 
  access_key = "AKI&JHDYJDSMRMJDJNUCXET"
  secret_key ="LIDDBYDhgdyndndjsmkVP76bxVrEzHSUBDugbBWEtsb6P" 
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_dashboard" "example_dashboard" {
  dashboard_name = "Neofinal"

  dashboard_body = jsonencode({
    widgets = [
      {
        type = "metric",
        x    = 0,
        y    = 0,
        # The X and Y coordinates on the dashboard grid where the widget will be placed.
        width = 12,
        height = 6,
        # which determine its size on the dashboard.
        properties = {
          view = "timeSeries",#Specifies the type of visualization, which is "timeSeries" for a time-based line chart.
          stacked = false, # Specifies whether the metrics should be stacked in the visualization (in this case, it's set to false).
          metrics = [
[ { "expression": "SELECT AVG(CPUUtilization) FROM SCHEMA(\"AWS/EC2\", InstanceId) GROUP BY InstanceId ORDER BY AVG() DESC limit 3", "label": "", "id": "q1", "region": "us-east-1" } ]
          ],
      
          "stat":"Average",
          region = "us-east-1",  # Set your desired region
          title = "EC2-CPU-Utilization"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
